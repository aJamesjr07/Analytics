The city that has the most total quantity sales are San Francisco (50,239), Los Angeles (33,289) and New York City (27,932)\n\n- To maximize the company's advertising efforts, it is recommended to advertise in December, October, and April, as the company generated the most orders during these months (4,613,443 USD, 3,736,726 USD, and 3,390,670 USD, respectively).\n\n- Tuesdays were found to be the most profitable day for advertising, generating 5,087,957 USD, while Thursdays had the lowest number of sales(4,839,465 USD).\n\n- The best times for advertising were between 10:00-12:00 and 18:00-20:00, when the company typically had the highest sales.\n\n- Top 5 Best selling product are AAA Batteries (4-pack)(31,017), AA Batteries (4-pack)(27,635), USB-C Charging Cable (23,975), Lightning Charging Cable(23,217), and Wired Headphones (20,557).\n\n- Products that are often sold together are Lightning Charging Cable and iPhone which sold 886 orders, and USB-C Charging Cable,Google Phone ranked second with 859 orders, and the third most are Wired Headphones and iPhone 443 orders.\n\n- The probability of customers ordering specific products compared to all other products was calculated as following: \n       * USB-C Charging Cable: 11.77% \n       * iPhone: 3.67% \n       * Google Phone: 2.97% \n       * Wired Headphones: 10.15%","metadata":{}}]}
